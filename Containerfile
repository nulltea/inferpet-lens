# talens ROCm runtime for AMD Strix Halo (gfx1151).
#
# Thin layer on AMD's official rocm/pytorch image — the only pre-built
# image whose PyTorch HIP layer is compiled with gfx1151 in the target
# list (no HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION needed). This is the SAME base the
# AloePri ima-trainer uses; we reuse its cached layers rather than
# duplicating the ROCm runtime or pip-installing a torch wheel (a
# separately-installed ROCm wheel lacks gfx1151 kernels and dies with
# hipErrorInvalidDeviceFunction — see private-rag
# evals/aloepri-attacks/m2_7/Dockerfile.ima-trainer).
#
# We add ONLY the small pure-python deps talens needs; torch is inherited.
# Build via scripts/run_in_rocm.sh (auto-builds if missing).

# Gemma-scope SAE probes via sae-lens. Installed so it does NOT clobber the
# inherited ROCm torch/torchvision: sae-lens + transformer-lens pull a PyPI
# torchvision that exact-pins (and thus downgrades) torch, so install THOSE
# TWO with --no-deps and supply their (pure-python, non-torch-pinning) deps
# separately. Recipe validated in scripts/spikes/_resolve_sae_deps.sh.
